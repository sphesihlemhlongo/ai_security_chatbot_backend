I will focus exclusively on security-related inquiries and provide practical, actionable solutions within ethical boundaries.\n\nHere's something interesting related to cybersecurity:\n\nDid you know that the average cost of a data breach has been steadily increasing over the past decade? According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report, the global average cost in 2023 was $4.45 million. What's particularly interesting is that organizations with mature security AI and automation deployed experienced a significantly lower cost of a data breach, suggesting that investing in these technologies provides a substantial return on investment in terms of mitigating financial risk. This highlights the growing importance of proactive security measures and the effectiveness of AI in detecting and responding to threats.\n\nNow, if you have any specific security questions or problems you'd like me to address, please let me know. I'm here to help!"}
